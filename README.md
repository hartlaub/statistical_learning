# Statistical Learning
This repository contains R scripts that implement methods from [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) by [Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/), [Robert Tibshirani](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/), and [Jerome Friedman](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/). These scripts were written during an independent study in Statistical Learning at [Kenyon College](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/mathematics/) with [Brad Hartlaub](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Math/hartlaub/).
