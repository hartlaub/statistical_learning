# Statistical Learning
This repository contains R scripts that implement methods from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (ISL) by [Gareth James](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/), [Daniela Witten](http://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/), [Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/), and [Robert Tibshirani](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/) and [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) (ESL) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and [Jerome Friedman](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/). These scripts originated during an independent study in Statistical Learning with [Brad Hartlaub](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Math/hartlaub/) at [Kenyon College](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/mathematics/).

The `Exercises` folder contains scripts that implement solutions to select problems in ISL and ESL.

The `Implementations` folder contains scripts that document the general implementation of various learning methods from ISLR and ESL. Each script describes the usage of two implementations: a *homemade* implementation that was originally coded, and an *official* implementation (i.e. contained in a package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)).
