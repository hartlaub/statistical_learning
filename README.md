# Statistical Learning
This repository contains R scripts that implement methods from [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) (ESL) by [Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/), [Robert Tibshirani](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/), and [Jerome Friedman](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/). These scripts originated during an independent study in Statistical Learning at [Kenyon College](http://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-programs/mathematics/) with [Brad Hartlaub](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Math/hartlaub/).

The `Exercises` folder contains scripts that implement solutions to select problems in ESL.

The `Implementations` folder contains scripts that document the general implementation of various learning methods from ESL. Each script walks through the usage of two implementations: a "homemade" implementation that was originally coded, and an "official" implementation (i.e. contained in a package from CRAN).
